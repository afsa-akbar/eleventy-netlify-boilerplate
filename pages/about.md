# I want to live in a world where no one is left behind and people are empowered to get what they need.

<br>

## I make sense of complexities through understanding and mapping people’s needs and behaviour with a service.

## I founded [Spark + Symphony](https://www.sparkandsymphony.com/), supporting organisations to build products and services that empower people and communities to get what they need.

## I co-run [Service Lab](http://weareservicelab.com/) and [London GovJam](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/london-gov-jam-27454665733), building communities for people to share their curiosity and passion for Service Design.

## I'm keen on giving back and helping others on their journey, I co-founded and mentor at [Mega Mentor](https://mega-mentor.com/).

## If you'd like to know more, have a look at my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t7PKey_fxTEsaInyGgOf7kTSnPMqsAfn/view?usp=sharing) or [get in touch](https://afsaakbar.netlify.app/contact/).
