# Hi, Salaam

I’m Afsa, an experienced service designer, committed to designing experiences that put people first.

I want to live in a world where noone is left behind and people are empowered to get what they need in times of crisis.

I make sense of complexities through understanding and mapping people’s needs and behaviour with a service.

I founded Spark + Symphony, supporting organisations to build products and services that empower people and communities to get what they need.

I also co-run Service Lab and London GovJam, building communities for people to share their curiosity and passion for Service Design.

I'm also keen on giving back and helping others on their journey, I co-founded and mentor at Mega Mentor.

If you'd like to know more, have a look at my CV.

Feel free to connect with me on Twitter, LinkedIn or email me on afsa@afsaakbar.com.

It would be great to hear from you! :)
